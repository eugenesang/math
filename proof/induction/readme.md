# Proof by induction

A proof by induction of P(n), a mathematical statement involving a value n, involves these main steps:

1. **Base Case:** Proof that P is correct for the initial value of n.
2. **Induction hypothesis:** Assume for some value k that P(k) is correct.
3. **Induction step:** Considering P(k) is correct show that P(k+1) is also correct.

## Example:
