# Base N

` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 ` are numbers in base 10 series.

Which means that any value can be represented using any combinations of these number

## Binary

In binary system any value is represented with either `0` or `1` such that if you count from 1 to 10 in binary, it looks like:

| Normal number | Binary number |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| 0            | 0             |
| 1            | 1             |
| 2            | 10            |
| 3            | 11            |
| 4            | 100           |
| 5            | 101           |
| 6            | 110           |
| 7            | 111           |
| 8            | 1000          |
| 9            | 1001          |
| 10           |  1010         |

If you look at this you realize that we are just writing down all numbers from 1 to 1010 while ignoring all the numbers that don't have a `zero` or a `one`.

In this sense, we have to find a mathematical way of mapping a normal base 10 number to a binary number and vice versa
